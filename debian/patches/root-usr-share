Description: set /usr/share/ruby-jsduck as the root_dir
  At least two subdirectories of root_dir are being used (template-min &
  js-classes). The current value was very gem-specific and in the package it
  was set to "/usr/lib/ruby", an obviously wrong choice. Hardcode our value,
  this should probably be made configurable before pushing upstream.
